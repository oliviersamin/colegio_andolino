## Technical approach

### The money criteria is crucial so we are focusing on open-source / free solutions

#### Hardware aspect:
1. getting school's own server to stock the database & communicate with parents
    technical solution possible: Raspberry Pi inside the school with internet connection

#### Software aspect:
1. Create a database from the actual data inside the existing excel sheets. 
2. Use Telegram to communicate from anywhere outside the school to the server to do actions:
    a. ask it informations (messages)
    b. send documents to be downloaded & to be processed to be stored in the database
    c. receive documents that have been generated such as Excel files
    d. manage permissions regarding the different circles by allowing different actions in different groups of 
    Telegram in which the biot is always an admin
